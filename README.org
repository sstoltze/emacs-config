* emacs-config

This repository was set up to allow me to synchronise my setup across multiple computers using various platforms (Linux, Windows, Windows with Cygwin). It contains a makefile with rules for what to install on the different platforms, so everything can be set up by running
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/sstoltze/emacs-config
cd emacs-config
make install
#+END_SRC
on any system with git, make and stow (for Linux and Cygwin) installed.
